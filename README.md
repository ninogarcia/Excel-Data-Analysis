# Metropolitan Commuting Analysis With EXCEL

## Hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between gender, impact of traffic, and job satisfaction. Specifically, being female and experiencing higher levels of traffic impact are associated with lower job satisfaction.

## INTRODUCTION
In this study, I conducted an online survey to investigate the daily commuting experiences of individuals and explore the potential relationship between gender, traffic impact, and job satisfaction. The modern work environment often involves significant time spent commuting, and understanding how factors such as gender and traffic influence job satisfaction can have valuable implications for both individuals and employers.

### Survey Sections
The survey comprised the following sections:

1. Respondent ID: Each respondent was assigned a unique identifier to ensure anonymity and enable the organization of survey data.

2. Age: The age of each respondent was recorded to gain insights into potential age-related patterns in commuting behaviors and job satisfaction.

3. Gender: This section aimed to capture the gender of each respondent, which plays a crucial role in understanding any gender-based variations in commuting experiences.

4. Mode of Transportation: Participants were asked to describe the primary mode of transportation they used for their daily work commute, shedding light on the diversity of commuting methods.

5. Travel Duration (hours/minutes): This column quantified the duration of daily work commutes in terms of hours and minutes, providing insights into the time individuals spend traveling.

6. Number of Transportation Used: Respondents were asked about the number of transportation modes they used for their daily work commute, revealing patterns of multi-modal commuting.

7. Impact of Traffic: This section aimed to assess the impact of traffic on each respondent's daily commute, indicating whether traffic congestion significantly affected their travel experience.

By analyzing the data collected through this survey, we aim to understand how gender and the impact of traffic are associated with job satisfaction. The findings from this study can contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges individuals face during their daily commutes and the potential effects on job satisfaction, thereby informing possible strategies for improving overall work-life quality.

## DATA COLLECTION AND ANONYMIZATION
The data for this study was collected using Google Forms, with respondents providing insights into their daily commuting experiences voluntarily. To safeguard the privacy of all participants, the following anonymization process was implemented:

1. **Respondent ID:** Respondents' real names were replaced with unique respondent IDs. This step ensured that individual identities remain anonymous throughout the analysis.

2. **No Personal Identifiers:** The survey did not collect any personal identifiers such as addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses. All potentially identifying information was omitted to protect the privacy of respondents.

Through these anonymization measures, the dataset has been effectively de-identified, allowing for the exploration of commuting patterns without compromising the confidentiality of individual respondents.

## DATA CLEANING
During the data analysis process, it was observed that the fields of Travel Duration and Total Number of Transportations Used contained inconsistencies. To ensure the data's accuracy and coherence, a thorough data cleaning process was undertaken.

### Travel Duration
The Travel Duration field originally included various textual representations, such as "mins," "min," or "minutes." To standardize the data, these textual elements were removed, leaving only the numerical values representing travel duration in minutes. This step facilitated better analysis and comparison across the dataset.

### Total Number of Transportations Used
The Total Number of Transportations Used field presented some instances of missing or incorrect data. To address these issues, the following steps were applied:

**Handling Missing Data:** For any missing values in the Total Number of Transportations Used field, appropriate imputation techniques were used. This ensured that missing data did not impact the integrity of the analysis.

**Validation and Correction:** The field was thoroughly validated to identify and correct any data entry errors or inconsistencies, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the cleaned dataset.

The cleaned dataset, which includes the standardized Travel Duration and corrected Total Number of Transportations Used, can be found in the attached Excel file available in this repository. The Excel file also contains the formulas used to perform the data cleaning.

## DATA ANALYSIS

The analysis for this project was guided by the following research questions:

1. What is the most popular mode of transportation used?	
	According to the data presented on the Dashboard, the most popular mode of transportation used among respondents is the Jeepney. It stands out as the preferred choice based on the frequency of selection by the survey participants.
		
2. How does age impact job satisfaction considering travel?	
	The impact of age on job satisfaction, considering travel, appears to be relatively consistent. Analysis of the data depicted on the Dashboard reveals that across various age brackets, job satisfaction tends to fall within the medium range. This suggests that age alone does not appear to be a significant factor influencing job satisfaction in relation to travel.
	
3. How does gender impact job satisfaction considering travel and traffic?	
	The analysis of the data on the dashboard indicates that gender does not appear to have a significant impact on job satisfaction when considering travel and traffic. Both male and female respondents demonstrate a similar level of job satisfaction, falling within the medium range. Thus, gender does not seem to play a substantial role in influencing job satisfaction in relation to travel and traffic.


### Dashboard Sheet

To facilitate the visualization and interpretation of our findings, a Dashboard Sheet was created in the Excel file. The Dashboard Sheet includes interactive charts, graphs, and visualizations that provide a comprehensive overview of the key results from our analysis.

The Dashboard Sheet offers an intuitive way to explore the data and gain insights into the research questions outlined above. Users can interact with the charts and filter the data based on specific criteria, enhancing the accessibility and usability of the analysis.

### Data Calculations

The calculations and data manipulations used to generate the results presented in the Dashboard Sheet can be found in a separate sheet within the Excel file. This sheet contains the formulas and functions employed to perform the necessary computations for the analysis.

Researchers and data enthusiasts can refer to this separate sheet to understand the step-by-step calculations that underpin the data visualizations and insights provided in the Dashboard Sheet.

The Excel file with the Dashboard Sheet and Data Calculations can be accessed in this repository. Users are encouraged to explore the interactive dashboard and leverage the cleaned data for further research and analysis.
