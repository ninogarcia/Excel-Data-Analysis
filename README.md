# Metropolitan Commuting Analysis

## Hypothesis: There is a significant relationship between gender, impact of traffic, and job satisfaction. Specifically, being female and experiencing higher levels of traffic impact are associated with lower job satisfaction.

## Introduction
In this study, I conducted an online survey to investigate the daily commuting experiences of individuals and explore the potential relationship between gender, traffic impact, and job satisfaction. The modern work environment often involves significant time spent commuting, and understanding how factors such as gender and traffic influence job satisfaction can have valuable implications for both individuals and employers.

### Survey Sections
The survey comprised the following sections:

1. Respondent ID: Each respondent was assigned a unique identifier to ensure anonymity and enable the organization of survey data.

2. Age: The age of each respondent was recorded to gain insights into potential age-related patterns in commuting behaviors and job satisfaction.

3. Gender: This section aimed to capture the gender of each respondent, which plays a crucial role in understanding any gender-based variations in commuting experiences.

4. Mode of Transportation: Participants were asked to describe the primary mode of transportation they used for their daily work commute, shedding light on the diversity of commuting methods.

5. Travel Duration (hours/minutes): This column quantified the duration of daily work commutes in terms of hours and minutes, providing insights into the time individuals spend traveling.

6. Number of Transportation Used: Respondents were asked about the number of transportation modes they used for their daily work commute, revealing patterns of multi-modal commuting.

7. Impact of Traffic: This section aimed to assess the impact of traffic on each respondent's daily commute, indicating whether traffic congestion significantly affected their travel experience.

By analyzing the data collected through this survey, we aim to understand how gender and the impact of traffic are associated with job satisfaction. The findings from this study can contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges individuals face during their daily commutes and the potential effects on job satisfaction, thereby informing possible strategies for improving overall work-life quality.

## Data Collection and Anonymization
The data for this study was collected using Google Forms, with respondents providing insights into their daily commuting experiences voluntarily. To safeguard the privacy of all participants, the following anonymization process was implemented:

1. **Respondent ID:** Respondents' real names were replaced with unique respondent IDs. This step ensured that individual identities remain anonymous throughout the analysis.

2. **No Personal Identifiers:** The survey did not collect any personal identifiers such as addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses. All potentially identifying information was omitted to protect the privacy of respondents.

Through these anonymization measures, the dataset has been effectively de-identified, allowing for the exploration of commuting patterns without compromising the confidentiality of individual respondents.
